Raw data of the manuscript entitled: "A New Model System for Studying Developmental Neuronal Remodeling and Its Relation to Behavior in Drosophila" by Israel and Parnas, 2025.

This repository includes raw data used in the manuscript. 
The data are organized in folders and subfolders. 
Each folder contains data associated with a specific main or supplementary figure. 
Each subfolder includes data associated with a particular figure panel within a specific main or supplementary figure. 

* Since the vectors representing translational velocity, angular velocity, and angular speed were slightly misaligned with optogenetic stimulation onset, the elements of each vector were shifted forward by four positions. In addition, the last two elements of each vector were removed. The resulting modified vectors were accurately aligned with light stimulation timing. Importantly, these modifications were performed only for visualization purposes and had no impact on data analysis.
